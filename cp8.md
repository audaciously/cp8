midterm 2 review
- know basics of quicksort (which uses recursion w/ a pivot) and recursion (calling method on itself until reaches base case)
- exceptions 
- generics
- collections: lists, stacks, queues, sets, maps, and enum

programming question context - poker (strategies and how shuffling works), how Collections.shuffle() works
- one or two methods, how to rig the shuffling method specifically
- most of code given to us (poker game that works without bias, change it to give winning hands a bit more)
- probabistical approach

- one 50 min programming question, fill in missing code
- zybooks submission ends at 12:22pm
- open book, use any online resources (how to shuffle objects)
- no chatting with human beings
